@brief Finds filenames that occur more than once in a directory tree.
@details Recursively searches the @p path and reports the paths to files whose
	names occur more than once in the directory tree.
@attention The filenames are made lowercase before comparison.
@param path The path to recursively search.
@param excluded_exts A list of lower-case file extentions to ignore.
@param aliased_exts A list of lists of lower-case file extentions. All
	extentions in a list will be treated as the first extention. For example,
	@c [[".tga", ".tpc"]] will treat both ".tga" and ".tpc" file names as
	".tga", meaning that if you have a @c name.tga and a @c name.tpc , the
	@c name.tpc will be listed as a duplicate of @c name.tga .
